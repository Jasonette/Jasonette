Create your own native Android and iOS app with nothing but JSON. Then send it over the Internet.

This repository serves two purposes:

**1. Project Board for [Jasonette](https://www.jasonette.com) Development**

**2. Discussing JASON specification** - [The issues section](https://github.com/Jasonette/Jasonette/issues) is used for discussing and deciding on the specification of JASON markup. The goal is to keep the syntax clean, consistent and efficient by hearing ideas from as many people as possible.
